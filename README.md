Battleship Game ðŸš¢ðŸŽ¯

Project Overview
This project is a digital implementation of the classic Battleship game, where two players compete to sink each other's ships. The game features both a text-based version and a GUI-based version with interactive elements. The objective is to locate and destroy enemy ships hidden on a board.

Gameplay
- The game consists of two players: Captain and General.
- Ships are placed on a board but are invisible to the players.
- Players take turns guessing ship locations and firing at them.
- A ship sinks when it is hit twice.
- The player who sinks the most ships wins.
- After the game, players can choose to restart or exit.
  
Conclusion
- This project was an exciting challenge in designing an engaging and interactive game. - We successfully built a working Battleship game and gained valuable experience in game development, UI/UX design, and player interaction.
